            <p class="sectiontag text-big">What Is Education ?</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a 'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28
                states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the
                policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national
                policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha Empire.
                Shivaji Bhonsale was born in the Shivneri Fort in Maharashtra on 19 February 1630 to mother Jijabai and
                father Shahaji Bhonsale. It is said that mother Jijabai prayed to Lord Shiva in Shivneri Fort for a
                brave son and kept her son name as Shivaji after the Hindu god Shiva.[1]

                Shivaji Maharaj is one of the revered historical figures of Maharashtra. He created an independent and
                sovereign state in the Maharashtra region. In course of time, his prominence in the political sphere of

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Indian culture is the heritage of social norms, ethical values,
                traditional customs, belief systems, political systems, artifacts and technologies that originated in or
                are associated with the ethno-linguistically diverse India. The term also applies beyond India to
                countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to India by immigration, colonisation, or
                influence, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. India's languages, religions, dance, music,
                architecture, food and customs differ from place to place within the country.

                Indian culture, often labelled as a combination of several cultures, has been influenced by a history
                that is several millennia old, beginning with the Indus Valley civilization and other early cultural
                areas.[1][2] Many elements of Indian culture, such as Indian religions, mathematics, philosophy,
                cuisine, languages, dance, music and movies have had a profound impact across the Indosphere, Greater
                India and the world.</p>
